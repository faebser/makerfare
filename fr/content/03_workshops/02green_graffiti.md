&bdquo;Instead of using spray cans some artist are just cleaning dirt off of certain areas to make their masterpieces and they are calling it reverse graffiti.&rdquo;

My workshop is a kind of reverse graffiti workshop &ndash; instead of painting a new layer to reality we wipe some older ones, to see the backgound of it. Mulhouse&rsquo;s flourishing historical industry inspired me to clean floral patterns onto the dirt covered factory building. As a research, we strart the workshop with finding the leading motives from historical printed patterns of the city. After I show the traditional way of making a big mural of a small handsketch and then starts the work itself. By the end of the 3 days we&rsquo;ll make a huge, dusty coloured memorial not just about Mulhouse&rsquo;s industry,but also for Europe&rsquo;s 20th century.
