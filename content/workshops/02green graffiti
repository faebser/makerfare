Green Graffiti

„Instead of using spray cans some artist are just cleaning dirt off of certain areas to make their masterpieces and they are calling it reverse graffiti.”

My workshop is a kind of reverse graffiti workshop – instead of painting a new layer to reality we wipe some older ones, to see the backgound of it. Mulhouse’s flourishing historical industry inspired me to clean floral patterns onto the dirt covered factory building. As a research, we strart the workshop with finding the leading motives from historical printed patterns of the city. After I show the traditional way of making a big mural of a small handsketch and then starts the work itself. By the end of the 3 days we’ll make a huge, dusty coloured memorial not just about Mulhouse’s industry,but also for Europe’s 20th century.
